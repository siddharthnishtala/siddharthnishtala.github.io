Participated in the data science category of Capgemini's Tech Challenge 2018. Competed against 6870 participants from all across the country in an online contest and was placed 1st on the leaderboard. The final round was an offline hackathon for top 5 on the leaderboard in Capgemini's Pune campus. I was awarded the 1st prize and a cash prize of Rs. 30,000.

In addition to the final round, all finalists were put in 6-member teams for a parallel hackathon to build solutions for garbage site identification. Our team competed against 9 other teams and was awarded the 2nd prize and a cash prize of Rs. 2,00,000.
