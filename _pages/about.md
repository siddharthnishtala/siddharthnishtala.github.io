I am an MS student at the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in), [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in) and am advised by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). I am also associated with the [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in).

I am currently working on a project in collaboration with Google AI and ARMMAN to improve maternal and child health outcomes by increasing engagement in a call-based information program through targeted interventions. Specifically, we are exploring the restless bandits framework for planning and making interventions to retain beneficiairies in the program. 

My other interests include multi-task and meta learning.

When I am not working, you will find me reading about Cricket or Formula 1.
